# AlexServerPluginPublic

AlexServerPlugin is a private plugin because of security reasons. I am the owner of the private plugin. Please contact me or my admins to have access to it.

# Disclaimer

- i give some credit to Volas171 for contributing some code in the private AlexServerPlugin. However, he betrayed us and leaked the webhooks that was in the plugin. This is a security flaw and my mistake to have the webhook exposed. This is all the credit i will ever give to him. Volas171 is no longer affiliated with ALEX servers in anyway anymore.
- use the other exposed plugin at your own risk.
